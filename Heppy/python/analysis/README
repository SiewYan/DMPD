What follows describes the python scripts allowing the analysis of flat ntuples.

The set of ntuples is defined in datasets.py together with related ancillary information (colors, labels, plotting order, etc.)

The current ntuples structure expects 4 TTrees with well defined names to live in the same file.
The input is managed in the setup.py class (grow_trees() method)

The processing of the ntuples is configurable, by means of the Configuration class in setup.py

The selections are (pre-)defined in selections.py. Further selections can be put together on the fly via the Configuration instance
or can be added/edited in selections.py. Names of the variables should match those in the tree

The possible plots are defined in observables.py. Furhter plot can be defined on the fly via the Configuration instance
or can be added/edited in observables.py. Names of the variables should match those in the tree

Execution options:
 - python -i process.py
 plot the given variable in the given region defined in process.py

 - python -i multiprocess.py
 plot the set of variables in the given regions defined in multiprocess.py
 a process per plot is launched, care must be put to limit the number of processes to a limited amout

 - python generate_datasets.py
 generated a set RooDatasets with only the events passing the selections and storing only the set of
 variables defined in generate_datasets.py
